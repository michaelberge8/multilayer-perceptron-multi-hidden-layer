# multilayer-perceptron-multi-hidden-layer
This is a multilayer neural network (with multi-hidden layers) which solves the XOR problem. The perceptron is trained over a number of iterations defined by the user (epoch). The improvement of the network is graphed over the iterations and displayed. A visualization of the improvment of the network is also displayed during runtime.
